# GOALS:

* Build an ORM/application from scratch
* Practice visualization of databases
* We can use Ruby and SQL to determine/update the database structure
* The most important attribute of a Ruby instance is now the unique ID, not necessarily the memory code that points to the location in computer memory
* Notice the difference in how we set up our model files now that we're using SQL

# What is an ORM?

* Object Relational Mapper - an interface that takes information from a database and animates information into manipulatable objects.

# Domain Model: Mini-Twitter

* Users:
  - id
  - name
  - email

* Tweets:
  - id
  - message
  - user_id
